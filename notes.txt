Why We Write 
document.getElementById('id_name') = >  Cause Document means our webpage and i want to access particular id 
                                        for this reason we use getElementById .
document.getElementById('id_name').innerHTML = "<p> Hello World </p>"

innerHTML means it'll change the document value which is mention in the id
